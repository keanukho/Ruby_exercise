#Write a Ruby program that takes a person's birth year as a variable, calculates their age, and then prints a message with their birth year and current age.
# Have a variable for the birth year.
# Calculate the person's age (assuming the current year is 2024).
# Print a message that includes both the birth year and the calculated age

  current_year = 2024
  age = current_year - birth_year
  "You were born in #{birth_year} and you are #{age} years old."
